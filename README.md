## FAQ

### 1. How do I make this support other resolutions?
To ensure the UI displays correctly across different screen resolutions, force the UI resolution in FiveM settings to 1920x1080.

### 2. I use Qbox's Nitro system. How do I integrate it?
To integrate with Qbox's Nitro system, use the following code snippet:

```lua
qbx.entityStateHandler('nitroFlames', function(veh, netId, value)
    local plate = qbx.string.trim(GetVehicleNumberPlateText(veh))
    local cachePlate = qbx.string.trim(GetVehicleNumberPlateText(cache.vehicle))
    if plate ~= cachePlate then return end
    nitroActive = value
end)

qbx.entityStateHandler('nitro', function(veh, netId, value)
    local plate = qbx.string.trim(GetVehicleNumberPlateText(veh))
    local cachePlate = qbx.string.trim(GetVehicleNumberPlateText(cache.vehicle))
    if plate ~= cachePlate then return end
    nos = value
end)
```
